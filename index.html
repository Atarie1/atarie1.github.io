	<p>This is my site, which I have designed completely by myself. Apologies in advance.</p>
	<p>This site does not use any from of Online Website Designers such as Wix, SquareSpace or Wordpress.<br>This was coded in my own HTMl5, CSS, and JS. Very much a learn as I go basis.<br>Hosted by GitHub Pages and put on my own domain!</p><p>This site will offer many features for me to just use randomly, as well as have secrets! Shhh!</p>
	<p>So please check in any time and see whats new :)</p>
	<p>In the meantime, feel free to check out my other socials / links;</p>
