  <p>Once we heard the covid lockdown restrictions were lifting enough to travel, we began planning to meet up. We decided on a week during the UK Spring Half Term and booked flights early in the morning on the smallest airline for two tall giants. I brought a real Film camera with me on this trip and two reels of film. If I knew this would be the only time I get to physically meet Jen, I would have brought a real camera and taken more pictures.<br>
    <br>
    On the first day we all met, we arrived almost 5 hours too early for checking into the hotel. We decided to get lunch and walk around some parks near the central station. Unfortunately, it was too early in Spring and nothing had grown yet, but we still went around all the parks where there should be cherry blossom trees. Once we got to the hotel, we realised we forgot to bring any UK to EU power adapters, and did a bit of shopping back to the hotel. Skye had been awake for over 28 hours! And immediately went to sleep. Leaving Jen and I to our own devices. We decided to go on a stroll around the city, back to her family’s apartment. She showed me the beige bridge next to her window, which she hated. Whilst we were there, she quickly dropped into her apartment to grab her Nintendo Switch Dock and some Switch Games. We would then spend the next 7 hours in my hotel room, playing Switch Games such as Mario Kart and a Brain Game. We’d watch German TV and I would make a few jokes about an Old film that I couldn’t understand the plot to as I don’t know German. When we parted ways we were so confused, Daylight saving times had just started and it seems like the whole film played in only 15 minutes. We laughed it off, hugged, and said good night.<br>
    <br>
    The next day. I woke up still thinking I had work and got up at 6 am. To my surprise, Jen was also up. She chatted whilst waiting for Skye to wake up and mentioned that she thought she overslept. She woke up in a panic thinking “What am I doing at home sleeping. Where are you two?”. Once Jen finished some chores and walked Evi, we met at the hotel again and made our way to the Zoo. We got tickets for both the outside area, and the aquarium section, we spent a lot of time outside, taking pictures and seeing animals. Once we started walking to the aquarium building, we realised we had taken too long and only had an hour left before they closed. We had to run around the whole building quickly, whilst still making the most of it. When we got back from the Zoo, we got some food delivered and played on switches for the rest of the day.<br>
    <br>
    On Saturday (26th) Jen wanted us to come to the apartment and meet Evi, but she was too shy to introduce us to her family. We had to wait til 12:30 (local time) to go to the apartment. To kill time, Skye took extra long getting ready, then we took a detour to an Aldi on the way. Once we got into the apartment, we met Evi. She is crazy. I can’t recall what we did or spoke about, but I know that whilst we were then Regina, Jen’s Mum, came back to the apartment to Jen’s surprise, and introduced us. It was very nice to meet Regina. She was very pleased to meet us and quite shocked at how tall we were when we stood up to greet her. Jen had to translate most of the conversation each way, but we had a nice chat. After meeting Regina, we went to a Minigolf area which featured Neon Lights and Bright Themes, we were having so much fun that I accidentally walked out with the special 3D glasses we were supposed to return once finished. After Golf, we went to Hamburger DOM, an amusement park on a Massive Scale, the biggest I’ve ever seen. We went on some rides, avoided some, and overall had a blast. This was also where Skye and Jen brought me the “Dad” hat for all my Dad jokes. We went back to the hotel and ordered some takeout, I took this time to secretly download my profile onto Jen’s switch without her knowing. When she went home, she found it and kept it for the next time we would go back.<br>
    <br>
    The 27th was my last day in Hamburg, and it was only a half day. My flight home was for the early evening, but with travel time and security, we left the hotel at 10 am. Most of that morning was spent texting each other (between Jen and me) about how much we would miss each other and poking some light jokes at some bruises she got from some of the rides’ extreme forces. On the train we were already planning on another time we could come back, or maybe a time when Jen could come to the UK. When we got to the security check-in, I gave one long hug with Jen. Holding back tears of saying goodbye. I didn’t want to let go. We could continue to text constantly whilst I walked through the security line, Jen was waiting by the entrance watching me move further down the line through the glass walls. Once I got through the checkpoint, I turned back through the crowd and I could barely see Jen’s pink coat. I waved goodbye and then went to the back of a bookstore to hide my tears, it didn’t work. Jen saw my tears and quickly pointed it out. We spent the whole time between security and boarding the plane texting over Discord. Sharing pictures we had gathered over the last few days. We both turned into Red Pandas.<br>
    <br>
    When I got home, I had just barely enough time to drop in at my parent’s house and wish my mum a happy Mother’s Day. We briefly spoke about all the fun we had, but I wanted to secretly get back to my flat and continue to message Jen. </p>
