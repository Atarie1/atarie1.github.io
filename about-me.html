		It all begins with an idea. Maybe you want to launch a business. Maybe you want to turn a hobby into something more. Or maybe you have a creative project to share with the world. Whatever it is, the way you tell your story online can make all the difference.<br><br>For me, it all began with the realisation I didn’t even attempt to make a personal site yet, for someone who spends as much time as I have on the internet. I am shocked that it took me this long to make an online profile for myself. Hello! It’s me! Just another nerd on the internet.<br><br>Full disclose, that picture of me in Disneyland is quite old now. I look quite different and need to update it.

When looking online to get something made in time for my next visit I accidentally came across a small QR code I can stick on the ground. I decided to make a whole webpage and stick it on a QR code, rather than use one small picture. I knew it would be a bit too much to make a site just for Jen, so I made this site. With the first page being dedicated to Jen's memory. I didn't get this idea done as it would have been quite costly at the time as I was just going to pay for a SquareSpace site. I changed my mind and decided to make this a better learning experience by hosting it on a GitHub page and making the site pretty much from scratch. </p>
